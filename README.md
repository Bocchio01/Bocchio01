# Welcome :panda_face:!

Here is Tommaso, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from @Politecnico_di_Milano.

Since the high school, where I had the opportunity to begin coding in **_C_**, I pursued this passion and explored as much as possible.

## Interests

**My main interests are in the fields of applied mathematics and robotics.**

I'm particularly fascinated by the idea of transcribe the real world physics into code using mathematical equations.

Currently I'm attending the _MSc Robotics and Mechatronic_ course at @Politecnico_di_Milano, where I'm exploring even more than I can do as a self-taught.

Have a nice coding day,
